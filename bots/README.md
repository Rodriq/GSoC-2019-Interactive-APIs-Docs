## What are bots in Rocket.Chat?

Bots (or Chatbots) are pieces of software that provide automated messaging in a
chat platform. They are useful for running pre-defined (scripted) interactions to provide
support, conversational workflow or on-boarding with multi-channel, multi-user, public and
private interactions. Bots can also be integrated with external services.

In Rocket.Chat, a bot is a special user account with the `bot` role and a specific set
of permissions.

## How do bots send and receive messages?

Bots in Rocket.Chat cannot send messages to users on thir own. Instead, they subscribe to
so-called collections of messages that every user has. The subscription creates a stream
that is updated every time messages are sent either directly to bots or any room they are joined in.

For more details, see the [Bots Architecture section](bots-architecture/#message-streams).

## How are bots hosted?

Rocket.Chat supports bots that are hosted _outside_ of your Rocket.Chat instance.
The working logic of these bots is defined by their provider.

For more details, see the [Bots Architecture section](bots-architecture/#bot-platforms-and-frameworks).

## Getting Started

These are the basic steps for using bots with Rocket.Chat:

1. A bot user is [created by an admin](creating-bot-users/) on the server;
2. The bot is running as [a separate process](bots-architecture/) using your chosen framework or platform;
3. The bot environment is pre-configured with [environment variables](configure-bot-environment/);
4. The bot's behavior is defined via scripts according to the requirements of your framework. For example, check the details on how to [run a bBot bot](running-a-bbot-bot/).

## Next steps

Get yourself familiar with [Bots Architecture](bots-architecture/).
