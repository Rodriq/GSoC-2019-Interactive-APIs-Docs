# Rate Limiter

The rate limiter is set by default on all api endpoints, with an amount set in the `Administration Panel => Rate Limiter => API Rate Limiter` for time interval (in milliseconds).
To disable the rate limiter you can add the `api-bypass-rate-limit` permission for your user group role in the `Administration -> Permission`.

To disable programmatically or change the rate limiter, such as the number of calls and the time interval,
simply provide for the API function `.addRoute`, within the existing options object that already defines `authRequired: true/false`,
a property `rateLimiterOptions`, providing `false` if you want disable the RateLimiter for this endpoint,
or by providing a valid configuration object with the desired configuration, in the following format `{numRequestsAllowed: 10, intervalTimeInMS: 60000}`.

The rate limiter is set by default in the development environment and can be disabled in the admin panel in the `Administration Panel => Rate Limiter => API Rate Limiter`.

For requests that are made to an api endpoint with a rate limiter, three extra properties will be sent by the request headers.

1. `x-ratelimit-limit`: The number of calls allowed for a certain amount of time.
2. `x-ratelimit-remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
3. `x-ratelimit-reset`: The time at which the current rate limit window resets in [UTC epoch milliseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
